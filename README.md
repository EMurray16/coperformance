# coperformance
New York Philharmonic and Social Network Analysis

This repository contains the code neccessary to run the coperformance app that's on my shiny server at overthinkdciscores.com/coperformance, except for two things:
1. The New York Philharmonic program history, which you can get yourself at their repository
2. The gcc compiled Go/C code PhilProcess.so, which can be compiled with the go code in the nyphil folder
